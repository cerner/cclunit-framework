## Anatomy of CCL Unit
A ***unit test*** is a null parameter subroutine whose name begins with "test".  
A ***test case*** is an include file with a ***.inc*** extension which contains unit tests and optionally setupOnce, setup, teardown and teardownOnce routines.  

CCL Unit generates a \[temporary\] program from a test case file and then executes the unit tests defined within that file.

A ***setupOnce*** is a null parameter subroutine named setupOnce.  
&nbsp; &bull; If a test case contains a setupOnce, CCL Unit will execute it before executing any of the unit tests in the test case.   
&nbsp; &bull; Use a setupOnce to perform any preparation steps that need performed one time before executing all the tests.  
A ***setup*** is a null parameter subroutine named setup.  
&nbsp; &bull; If a test case contains a setup, CCL Unit will execute it just before the execution of each unit test in the test case.  
&nbsp; &bull; Use a setup to perform any preparation steps that need to be freshly repeated before each test is executed.  
A ***teardown*** is a null parameter subroutine named teardown.  
&nbsp; &bull; If a test case contains a teardown, CCL Unit will execute it just after the execution of each unit test in the test case.  
&nbsp; &bull; Use a teardown to perform any cleanup steps (such as rollback) that need to be repeated after each test completes.  
A ***teardownOnce*** is a null parameter subroutine named teardownOnce.  
&nbsp; &bull; If a test case contains a teardownOnce, CCL Unit will execute it after all of the tests in the test case have finished executing.  
&nbsp; &bull; Use a teardownOnce to perform any final cleanup steps that need performed one time after all the tests have completed.  
An ***assert*** is a statement asserting a particular condition is true.  
&nbsp; &bull; [**Look here**][cclutAsserts] for details about asserts and a list of all the available asserts.  
&nbsp; &bull; Example:  `call cclutAssertVcEqual(CURREF, "expected hello world", some_str, "hello world")`  
A ***timer*** asserts the elapse between two execution points does not exceed a specified threshold.  
&nbsp; &bull; Start a timer named "timer name" by invoking `call cclutStartTimer("timer name", CURREF)`  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull;  The second parameter is optional and will default to CURREF.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull;  An error will occur if there already is a timer with the same name.  
&nbsp; &bull; To complete the timer invoke `call cclutEndTimer("timer name", threshold)`  

A unit test will fail if it has an assert that fails or a timer that does not meet its threshold or if a CCL error occurs while the test is executing. It will pass otherwise.  

## Mocking Framework
See [CCL Unit Mocking][ccl-unit-mocking] for instructions on mocking database data and other things for CCL Unit Tests.



## Manual Execution
During development it is desirable to perform the test phase of the modify/test/repeat cycle as swiftly as possible. 
Manually executing a single test provides for this and avoids the time overhead of the maven execution described farther down.

---
- Transfer your test case file to the back end.
- excute **cclut** or **cclut_ff**.
- Examine the output.
- Repeat.
 - If the test case file is modified, transfer it again.
 - If the testing target (script) is modified, recompile the script.

**cclut** and **cclut_ff** are prompt programs which generate a temporary program from a test case and execute its tests.  

If its failFast parameter is checked (true), **cclut** will fail fast, i.e., stop executing tests as soon as some test produces 
an assert failure or a runtime error. Otherwise it will continue executing tests even after it encounters assert failures or errors.
After all tests complete, **cclut** generates a report listing the status of every executed test along with 
a list of all failed asserts and runtime errors that were encountered.  

The **cclut_ff** program always fails fast and merely echoes out the final status preceded by information about the assert failure and/or 
errors which led to the failure in case the test case run was not successful.
It indicates whether the tests executed successfully and if not, indicates the assert failure or error that was encountered.  

Both **cclut** and **cclut_ff** have the following parameters:
 * outputLocation - location to write the output, "MINE" by default.
 * testCaseDirectory - logical name for the directory containing the test case file, "cclsource" by default.
 * testCaseName - (required) the name of the test case file with or without the .inc extension
 * testNamePattern - a regular expression to limit which tests are executed by matching the test name, ".*" by  default.
 * optimizerMode - the optimizer mode (CBO or RBO) to set when running the tests, the current system value by default.
 * deprecatedFlag - the severity level (E,W,I,L,D) if deprecated constructs are encounter when testing, E (error) by default.

**cclut** offers the following additional parameter:
 * failFast - indicate whether to fail fast or not, true by default.

Example:

`cclut "MINE", "ccluserdir", "ut_my_script", "testOne" go`

`cclut_ff "MINE", "ccluserdir", "ut_my_script", "", "CBO" go`

## Maven Execution
Maven is a build system that can transfer all of the source and test files to the back end, compile them, execute all of the test
cases, and collect the test results and code coverage data. 

See [ccl-maven-plugin][ccl-maven-plugin] for instructions.

Maven plugins can be configure to generate HTML reports displaying the test 
results and code coverage data which is stored in not particularly legible xml files as well as various other reports. 
See [ccl-testing][ccl-testing] to learn about the reporting plugins.
