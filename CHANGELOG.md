# cclunit-framework Change Log

## 3.0 - 2018.07.09
* Requires CCL version 8.12.0 or higher.

### Enhancements
* Update the framework to be 64-bit compatible.

## 2.0 - 2018.07.09
* Requires CCL version 8.9.3 or higher.

### Additions
* Add support for "operator asserts" using CCL's operator function.
* Add support for setupOnce and teardownOnce functions.
* Create the prompt programs cclut and cclut_ff for executing CCL unit tests directly from CCL or Discern Visual Developer.
* Create CCL Unit unit tests for the CCL Unit Framework to test itself.

### Corrections
* Prevent the framework from failing to log the asserts called from a unit test that calls go to exit_script.
* Escape CDATA tags within CDATA tags allowing the framework to test source code which contains a 
 CDATA tag in a comment or a literal string. This also opens the door for the framework to test itself.
* Update the framework to be able to identify unit test subroutines defined using CCL's in-line subroutine declaration syntax.
* Prefix all framework subroutine parameter names with "cclut" in order to prevent conflicts with testing targets and unit tests.
* Update the framework to use namespaces to better insulate testing targets from variables and subroutines defined by the framework.

### Enhancements
* Update the framework to support disabling code coverage for specific lines of code.
* Update the framework to support specifying the directory where the unit tests are located.
* Update the framework to support changing the deprecated severity which is E (error) by default.
* Update the framework to support changing the default behavior of producing an error if undeclared variables are used.
* Update cclut_get_framework_state to display the framework version and required minimum CCL version if executed directly from CCL or Discern Visual Devleoper.
* Refactor the framework to make it self-testable.
